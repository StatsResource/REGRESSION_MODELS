# Linear Regression Analysis

## Introduction

**Linear regression** is used when you want to predict the value of a variable based on another variable. The variable to be predicted is the **dependent variable** (or outcome), while the predictor is the **independent variable**.

For example:

- Predicting exam performance based on revision time  
- Estimating cigarette consumption from years of smoking

If you have two or more independent variables, use **multiple regression**.

Software like **SPSS** can perform linear regression, interpret the results, and provide outputs. However, it’s crucial to first confirm that your data satisfies certain **assumptions** for the analysis to be valid.

## Assumptions

There are six key assumptions to check before running a linear regression model.

### Assumption 1: Variable Type

Your two variables should be measured on an **interval or ratio scale** (i.e. continuous data). Examples include:

- Revision time (hours)  
- IQ score  
- Weight (kg)  
- Exam scores (0–100)

---

### Assumption 2: Linearity

There must be a **linear relationship** between the independent and dependent variable. The easiest way to check this is by generating a **scatter plot** in SPSS and inspecting it visually.

> If the pattern is non-linear, consider:
> - Using **non-linear regression**, or  
> - **Transforming** your variables (e.g. log, square root)

**Example**:

### Assumption 3: No Significant Outliers

Outliers are unusual data points that don’t conform to the general pattern and may distort predictions.

**Example**: A student with an IQ of 156 in a sample where the average is 108.

Outliers may heavily influence the regression line and can reduce model reliability.

**Example plot**:

> SPSS provides tools (e.g. casewise diagnostics) to detect and manage outliers.

### Assumption 4: Independence of Observations

Observations must be independent. This is typically tested using the **Durbin-Watson statistic** in SPSS. A value close to 2 suggests independence; values near 0 or 4 indicate potential autocorrelation.

---

### Assumption 5: Homoscedasticity

The **residuals** (errors) should have **constant variance** across the line of best fit.

Compare the scatterplots below for homoscedastic vs. heteroscedastic data:

> Real-world data might not be perfectly tidy — learn to assess and interpret this assumption properly and consider remedies like transformations or weighted regression.

---

### Assumption 6: Normally Distributed Residuals

The residuals (not the variables) should be approximately **normally distributed**.

Ways to check this in SPSS include:

- **Histogram** with a normal curve overlay  
- **Normal P–P Plot**

---

### Additional Notes

- You can test all assumptions **except Assumption 1** using SPSS.
- The order of checking matters — some violations may stop regression from being appropriate.
- If assumptions are violated, **don't panic** — alternative methods (e.g. robust regression) may be available.
