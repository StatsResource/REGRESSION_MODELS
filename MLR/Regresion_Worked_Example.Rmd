## Regression example

A survey was conducted in 9 areas of the USA to investigate the relationship between
divorce rate (y) and residential mobility (x). Divorce rates in the annual number per 1000 in the population
and the residential mobility is measured by the percentage of the population that moved house in the last
five years.Hereâ€™s a step-by-step tutorial for interpreting and solving both regression examples from your notes using standard formulas. Iâ€™ll walk through each question methodically:

---

## ðŸ“Š Regression Example 1: Divorce Rate & Residential Mobility

Given paired data (x: residential mobility, y: divorce rate) across 9 regions.

### âœ… Confirming Summations

Letâ€™s denote:

- \( \sum x = 426 \)
- \( \sum x^2 = 20494 \)
- \( \sum y = 48.7 \)
- \( \sum y^2 = 276.81 \)
- \( \sum xy = 2361 \)
- \( n = 9 \)

These values can be confirmed by manually calculating or using R.

---

### ðŸ“ˆ Regression Line

We use the formulas:

- **Slope**:
  \[
  b = \frac{n\sum xy - \sum x \sum y}{n\sum x^2 - (\sum x)^2}
  \]

- **Intercept**:
  \[
  a = \frac{\sum y - b \sum x}{n}
  \]

**Plug in the numbers**:

- \( b = \frac{9(2361) - 426(48.7)}{9(20494) - 426^2} \approx \frac{21249 - 20746.2}{184446 - 181476} \approx \frac{502.8}{2970} \approx 0.1693 \)

- \( a = \frac{48.7 - 0.1693(426)}{9} \approx \frac{48.7 - 72.1}{9} \approx \frac{-23.4}{9} \approx -2.60 \)

So, the regression equation is:
\[
\hat{y} = -2.60 + 0.1693x
\]

---

### ðŸ”® Predictions

For:
- \( x = 39 \): \( \hat{y} = -2.60 + 0.1693(39) \approx 4.01 \)
- \( x = 60 \): \( \hat{y} = -2.60 + 0.1693(60) \approx 7.56 \)

> The estimate at \( x = 39 \) is likely **more accurate** because it's closer to the mean of the x-values and well within the range of observed data (i.e. less risk of extrapolation error).

## ðŸ§ª Regression Example 2: Blood Flow vs. Auricular Pressure

Given:
- \( S_x = 126.5, \quad S_{xx} = 1381.85 \)
- \( S_y = 113, \quad S_{yy} = 1251 \)
- \( S_{xy} = 1272.2, \quad n = 12 \)

---

### ðŸ“ˆ Regression Equation

Slope:

\[
b = \frac{S_{xy} - \frac{S_x S_y}{n}}{S_{xx} - \frac{S_x^2}{n}}
\]

Intercept:

\[
a = \bar{y} - b\bar{x}
\]

First compute means:

- \( \bar{x} = \frac{126.5}{12} \approx 10.54 \)
- \( \bar{y} = \frac{113}{12} \approx 9.42 \)

Now:

- Numerator = \( 1272.2 - \frac{126.5 \cdot 113}{12} \approx 1272.2 - 1191.54 = 80.66 \)
- Denominator = \( 1381.85 - \frac{(126.5)^2}{12} \approx 1381.85 - 1333.02 = 48.83 \)

So:

- \( b = \frac{80.66}{48.83} \approx 1.652 \)
- \( a = 9.42 - 1.652(10.54) \approx 9.42 - 17.42 = -8.00 \)

Regression line:

\[
\hat{y} = -8.00 + 1.652x
\]

---

### ðŸ”— Correlation Coefficient

Using:

\[
r = \frac{nS_{xy} - S_x S_y}{\sqrt{(nS_{xx} - S_x^2)(nS_{yy} - S_y^2)}}
\]

Or simply confirm from R:

```r
cor(x, y)
# Output: 0.8521414
```

> A strong positive correlation (close to 1), indicating a strong linear relationship between pressure and blood flow.
