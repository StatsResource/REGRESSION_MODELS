# Tutorial: Interpreting Multiple Linear Regression Output in R

## Overview

We are modeling `profit` as a linear function of several predictors:

- Model 1 (`fit1`): `profit ~ QC + Mrkt + growth`
- Model 2 (`fit2`): `profit ~ QC + Mrkt + growth + unemp + yr`

## Step-by-Step Interpretation of Output

### 1. **Call**

This confirms the regression formula used. It helps verify which predictors were included in the model.

### 2. **Coefficients Table**

Each row corresponds to one model term (intercept or predictor), and each column gives:

- **Estimate**: The fitted coefficient; tells you the predicted change in `profit` for one unit increase in the predictor, holding others constant.
- **Std. Error**: Standard error of the estimate.
- **t value**: The test statistic for `H₀: β = 0`
- **Pr(>|t|)**: The p-value corresponding to the t-test. Lower p-values (< 0.05) suggest the predictor is statistically significant.

#### Example (fit1):
| Variable   | Estimate    | p-value  | Interpretation |
|------------|-------------|----------|----------------|
| QC         | 0.71        | 0.192    | Not significant. A 1-unit increase in QC increases predicted profit by ~0.71, but this isn’t statistically reliable. |
| Mrkt       | 12.78       | 0.009 ** | Significant. Market size is positively associated with profit. |
| growth     | -3041.92    | 0.119    | Not significant, but may suggest a negative trend if sample size were larger. |
| Intercept  | -840.96     | 0.018 *  | Starting value of `profit` when all predictors are zero (not always meaningful by itself). |

### 3. **Residual Standard Error (RSE)**

- `fit1`: 57.3
- `fit2`: 45.72

RSE gives an estimate of the typical size of the residuals (errors). Lower RSE is generally better. In `fit2`, the model fits the data more tightly.

### 4. **R-squared and Adjusted R-squared**

| Model | R-squared | Adjusted R² | Interpretation |
|-------|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| fit1  | 0.778     | 0.667       | 77.8% of variation in `profit` is explained. Adjusted for # of predictors, 66.7%. |
| fit2  | 0.9058    | 0.788       | Stronger explanatory power with more predictors, but adjusted R² increase is more modest (from 66.7% to 78.8%). |

> Adjusted R² is more reliable when comparing models with different numbers of predictors.

---

### 5. **F-Statistic and Model p-value**

| Model | F-statistic | Model p-value |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| fit1  | 7.01 (p = 0.02184) | Model is statistically significant overall. |
| fit2  | 7.692 (p = 0.03524) | Still significant, but with a bit more complexity and fewer degrees of freedom. |

---

### 6. **Interpretation Tips**

- Variables like `QC` and `growth` show weak evidence of individual significance, but may contribute jointly to the model.
- Adding predictors in `fit2` improved the overall R² and reduced error, but beware of **overfitting** with too many predictors.
- A predictor’s significance might shift due to **collinearity** or changing degrees of freedom.

---

## Summary

- ✅ Use the **coefficients and p-values** to assess which variables matter.
- ✅ Use **R² and Adjusted R²** to measure model quality and compare models.
- ✅ Use the **F-statistic** to assess if the model is statistically useful overall.
- ❗ Don’t over-interpret coefficients that aren’t statistically significant.
- ❗ Check assumptions visually (residual plots, normality) to verify model validity.
