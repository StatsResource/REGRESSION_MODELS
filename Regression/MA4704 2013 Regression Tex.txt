# Bivariate Data

- **Univariate statistics**: Analysis involving a single variable  
- **Bivariate statistics**: Analysis involving two variables \( X \) and \( Y \)  
- **Multivariate statistics**: Analysis involving more than two variables (not covered)

---

# Covariance

Covariance measures the strength and direction of the **linear relationship** between two variables.

\[
\text{cov}(X, Y) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n}(X_i - \bar{X})(Y_i - \bar{Y})
\]

---

# Variables in Regression Analysis

- \( X \): Independent (predictor) variable  
- \( Y \): Dependent (response) variable  
- Scatterplots help assess the relationship type (linear or nonlinear)

---

# Correlation and Cause-Effect

- A strong correlation does **not imply causation**
- Example: Negative correlation between ice cream sales and flu rates
  - Not causal—both are influenced by **weather**, a latent variable

---

# Scatterplots

Visual examples include:
- Strong positive linear relationship  
- Weak/no relationship  
- Strong nonlinear negative relationship  
- General nonlinear patterns

---

# Regression Estimates

Regression coefficients:

- Slope: \( b_1 \)
- Intercept: \( b_0 \)

Computed using:

\[
b_1 = \frac{S_{XY}}{S_{XX}}, \quad
b_0 = \bar{Y} - b_1 \bar{X}
\]

---

# Summation Calculations

- \( \sum X \): Sum of independent variable values  
- \( \sum Y \): Sum of dependent variable values  
- \( \sum X^2 \), \( \sum Y^2 \): Sum of squared values  
- \( \sum XY \): Sum of case-wise products

---

# Pearson's Correlation Coefficient

Used to assess **linear association** between two quantitative variables.

- Denoted \( r \)
- Range: \(-1 \leq r \leq 1\)
- Formula:

\[
r = \frac{S_{XY}}{S_X S_Y}
\]

---

# Other Correlation Coefficients

(Not covered in this course):

- Spearman’s Rank Correlation  
- Kendall Tau Correlation

---

# Example 1

Height of a boy observed across ages:

- Independent: Age  
- Dependent: Height  
- Use scatterplot and Pearson coefficient to assess relationship

---

# Example 2

Given:

- \( S_{XY} = -283.8 \)
- \( S_{XX} = 613.6 \)
- \( S_{YY} = 148.9 \)

### Part 1: Correlation

\[
r = \frac{-283.8}{\sqrt{613.6 \cdot 148.9}} \approx -0.9389
\]

→ Very strong negative linear relationship

### Part 2: Slope

\[
b_1 = \frac{-283.8}{613.6} \approx -0.4625
\]

---

# Hypothesis Testing for Regression

### Objective

Test whether slope \( \beta_1 = 0 \)

### Hypotheses

- \( H_0: \beta_1 = 0 \) → No linear relationship  
- \( H_1: \beta_1 \neq 0 \) → Linear relationship exists

### Standard Error of Slope

\[
S.E(b_1) = \sqrt{\frac{s^2}{S_{XX}}}
\]

Where:

\[
s^2 = \frac{SSE}{n - 2}, \quad
SSE = S_{YY} - b_1 S_{XY}
\]

---

# Residuals

- Residuals \( e_i = y_i - \hat{y}_i \)  
- **Positive residual**: Observed > Predicted  
- **Negative residual**: Observed < Predicted  
- Residuals quantify error and help validate model assumptions
